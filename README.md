## Spencer Livingston
Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub. I hope you'll check out some of the projects I am contributing to! I contribute to software I use often and I think they're worthy of support!

If you're interested in what I do, you can check me out in several places! Here on GitHub, I'm always checking in and am very responsive.

You can also check out my personal blog & portfolio website, where I host a wiki, blog, podcast and other things that might interest you.

I'm always interested in contributing to great Golang, Kotlin and Powershell projects!
